# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel fluent with for loops and have a good understanding.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I think it was a productive struggle, there wasn't any speed bumps that required me to take a step back and breath for a minute. Every challenges
was tackled head on through googling and note re-reading.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
No additional practice or learning is needed at this moment.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Further questions about loops can be sent to my small group if I'm unable to find an answer thats understandable to me.
